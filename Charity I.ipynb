Chris used to love playing soccer and now can never play again. Chris is currently 35 and volunteers for the Drunk Driving Prevention Program. The Drunk Driving Prevention Program works to spread awareness of the dangers of drunk driving and will drive any intoxicated person and their car home if they simply call.

He wanted to be an architect when he grew up and build a building “even bigger than the empire state building.” Derek was allergic to the proteins in several vaccines, including the measles vaccine. Derek should’ve been able to happily live his life and he should’ve grown up to be an architect, but he tragically died of measles.Due to the anti-vaccination movement many diseases such as the mumps and measles which were previously eradicated in the U.S have reappeared. This has tragically resulted in many children, like Derek, who are physically unable to become vaccinated, to die too soon. Founded by Derek’s mom, Moms for Vaccines is a nonprofit that works to vaccinate non-immunized children internationally, spread vaccination awareness, and debunk myths about the dangers of vaccination. They work to protect people like Derek. "
